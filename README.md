# FruitStore
FruitStore is an esoteric language.

I can't think of any word to describe it.

...Useless. And verbose. But I have fun making it! And I hope you all love it! Thanks!

Syntax can be seen [here](https://github.com/SketchySketch/FruitStore/blob/main/doc.md).

An ugly online compiler can be found [here](https://fruit-store-lang.vercel.app).
